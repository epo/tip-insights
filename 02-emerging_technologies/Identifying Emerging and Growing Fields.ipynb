    "# Identifying Emerging and Growing Fields: Evaluating Europe's Role in the Global Innovation Landscape\n",

    "### Prerrequisites\n",
    "This notebook has been written for an audience already familiar with TIP. For users completely new to the platform, we recommend to follow the [TIP basic course](https://e-courses.epo.org/course/view.php?id=416) before reading this analysis. \n",
    "### Disclaimer \n",
    "This notebook is published as a showcase of the capabilities of TIP as a data processing environment. It is not intended to derive any statistical conclusion other than the presentation of the retrieved data. The EPO is not expressing any opinion extrapolated from the analysis.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the face of increasing global competition, the **European Commission** has acknowledged the importance of *emerging sectors* to drive innovation and secure its economic future. While there are investments being made, these are often too limited or fragmented to keep pace with global leaders such as the **US**, **Japan**, **South Korea**, and **China**. *Emerging sectors* defined as fields characterised by their novelty, rapid development, and transformative potential are essential for addressing challenges like **climate change**, **digital transformation**, and advancements in **healthcare**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In light of this it is important to carefully assess areas where Member States might be trailing behind other innovation leaders. Identifying emerging fields of technology can be challenging, as these areas are not always immediately apparent. Once they are recognised, it becomes quite essential to evaluate Europe's position in these fields and consider whether the current level of investment is sufficient to sustain or enhance global competitiveness. This preliminary analysis aims to provide initial insights into how TIP (Technology and Innovation Platform) can be utilised to investigate whether Europe is dedicating adequate resources to these emerging areas and where there might be risks of falling behind. By examining patent trends and the geographic distribution of applicants within these technologies, the objective is to identify potential gaps that may require further attention. we aim to uncover areas requiring urgent attention to ensure **Europe’s long-term competitiveness** and leadership in the global innovation landscape, a focus that is highly relevant as highlighted in the report [*The future of European competitiveness: A competitiveness strategy for Europe*](https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/97e481fd-2dc3-412d-be4c-f152a8232961_en?filename=The%20future%20of%20European%20competitiveness%20_%20A%20competitiveness%20strategy%20for%20Europe.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that this analysis is deliberately simplified, serving as a starting point to guide a more detailed exploration of Europe’s positioning within the global innovation landscape. This analysis was conducted in February 2025, and the results discussed reflect the data available at that time. The process can be repeated, but it is important to consider that results may vary over time."

    "A critical step in understanding global innovation trends is identifying the technological areas that have experienced the most significant activity in recent years. To achieve this, we analyse *patent classifications* using the **Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC)** system, which provides a detailed taxonomy of technologies. Specifically, we focus on **CPC groups**, a level of classification that aggregates patents based on shared technological characteristics, offering a broader perspective on innovation trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis, we examine patents filed over the past decade, starting from **2013**. This time frame reflects the most recent developments and allows us to capture trends in rapidly evolving and *emerging fields*. By counting the occurrences of **CPC groups** associated with *patent families*, we highlight the most frequently represented technological areas. These counts act as a proxy for *innovation intensity*, illustrating which sectors are experiencing the highest levels of research and development globally.\n",

    "To ensure the robustness and comparability of our analysis, this study focuses on **International Patent Families (IPFs)**. **IPFs** represent high-value inventions for which patent protection has been sought in more than one jurisdiction. This approach provides a reliable and neutral proxy for inventive activity, allowing us to analyse technological developments with greater accuracy and consistency than would be possible by examining individual patent applications alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Patents are inherently territorial, with protection granted only within the jurisdiction of the patent office where the application is filed. Consequently, the count of patent applications at a national or regional level does not necessarily equate to the number of unique inventions. Many patent filings may represent minor refinements rather than distinct innovations. **IPFs** address this limitation by grouping patents filed across jurisdictions that relate to the same invention. Each **IPF** is defined as a unique invention for which patents have been filed in at least two countries, thereby ensuring that only inventions deemed commercially significant by their applicants are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "This methodology reduces biases that can arise from variations in patent filing practices across different jurisdictions. By aggregating related patents into families, **IPFs** create a homogeneous population of inventions that can be compared across countries and companies. This global perspective provides a more accurate measure of inventive activity, as it reflects innovations with broader market potential and strategic importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis, **IPFs** were identified using two key criteria. The first required that patent families include applications filed in at least two jurisdictions, ensuring that the inventions represented are of international significance. The second focused on families associated with organisations, highlighting commercially oriented inventions that are more likely to influence technological and industrial progress. This definition of an *international patent family* is one of the available options. TIP allows for defining these families in other ways as well. This serves as a starting point, and from here, decisions can be made to include or exclude certain cases based on the specific objectives of the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "By concentrating on **IPFs**, this study captures the most valuable and impactful innovations driving technological progress. This approach not only highlights high-priority fields but also provides a comprehensive understanding of how inventive activity is distributed globally, offering meaningful insights into regional and sectoral dynamics.\n"

    "As mentioned, we want to maintain a broader perspective and focus on larger fields that are innovatively significant, without delving too deeply into the specifics of individual technologies. Dividing the subclasses into broader fields can be done by using external sources such as the WIPO-IPC concordance table. This approach allows us to group related subclasses into wider technological areas, providing a more general overview while still capturing key trends and developments in innovation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **WIPO IPC Technology Concordance Table** offers a valuable framework for macro-level analysis of technological trends by grouping **IPC** subclasses into broader technology macrofields. This is especially useful for identifying where significant innovation is occurring across various sectors, as it provides a high-level overview of emerging technologies. The **CPC** and **IPC** systems share a similar hierarchical structure, allowing for easy alignment between the two and facilitating comparative analysis. By using the **WIPO IPC Concordance Table**, we can focus on identifying key technological areas where substantial innovation is happening, without being bogged down by the complexity of detailed subclass classifications. By relying on the WIPO IPC Concordance Table, we avoid the challenges of generalising classifications on our own, especially given the complexities involved in determining the specific applications of technologies.\n",

    "The grouping of **IPC** subclasses into macrofields enables a clearer understanding of global innovation dynamics and highlights the broader trends shaping the future of technology. This approach provides a more manageable and interpretable perspective, making it easier to track the development of emerging fields across different sectors. The macrofields help identify where innovation is most concentrated and which technologies are likely to drive future industrial shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important distinction in this context is the **CPC** \"Y\" class, which specifically addresses technologies related to climate change mitigation and adaptation. While the **WIPO IPC Technology Concordance Table** does not include this \"Y\" class, we think it might be crucial to treat these climate-related technologies separately, given their growing importance in global sustainability efforts. By doing so, we ensure that technologies such as clean energy solutions, sustainable practices, and climate resilience are clearly recognised as a unique category, distinct from other technological advancements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Incorporating the **WIPO IPC Technology Concordance Table** into our analysis allows for a structured and strategic overview of global technological trends. It not only enhances our understanding of innovation at a macro level but also ensures that critical fields receive the focused attention they deserve.

    "Before continuing with this preliminary analysis, we could try applying a definition of emerging fields by identifying them through the growth trend of innovation intensity within the broader technological fields. This would involve focusing on fields that are experiencing rapid development and increasing activity, which can be tracked through patent trends and the volume of new filings. By looking at these trends, we can pinpoint areas that are gaining momentum and might represent emerging sectors in the global innovation landscape. \n",
    "It is important to note that while we have observed a significant number of inventions in the fields we are analysing, this does not necessarily mean they are emerging sectors. These fields are undoubtedly characterised by novelty, as we are focusing on high-value inventions, which are patent families filed across multiple countries. The fact that these inventions are new adds to their transformative potential. They have the capacity to drive substantial change, as they often represent breakthroughs in technology and innovation, with applications that could reshape industries and societies.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the presence of many inventions in recent years does not automatically qualify these fields as emerging sectors. *Emerging sectors* are typically characterised not only by the volume of innovations but also by their potential for future growth and market disruption. To identify true emerging sectors, we must look at the trends over time. Some sectors may have consistently seen a high volume of inventions, and their dynamism could be more evolutionary rather than revolutionary. Rapid evolution in these sectors may simply reflect the ongoing progression of established technologies rather than the rise of entirely new, transformative areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of growing sectors, we might observe significant levels of activity due to the continuous evolution of existing technologies. These sectors can exhibit high growth and dynamism, where players’ market shares change drastically, often due to technological advancements or shifts in market demand. Such sectors are not necessarily emerging, but they can still capture a large share of economic growth due to their established nature and ongoing developments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, while we observe high levels of invention activity, we need to carefully assess whether these fields truly represent emerging sectors or whether they are growing sectors with substantial but stable innovation over time. Growing sectors may exhibit high growth and dynamism, but they do not necessarily represent entirely new or disruptive technological frontiers. *Emerging sectors*, on the other hand, often demonstrate a sharper and more accelerated growth trajectory, reflecting the introduction of highly novel and potentially disruptive technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disruptive inventions tend to act as catalysts within their respective fields, sparking a chain reaction of related innovations. This occurs because groundbreaking technologies often uncover previously unexplored opportunities or address fundamental challenges in entirely new ways. These inventions can redefine the parameters of a field, leading to the development of complementary technologies, refinements, and derivative applications. Additionally, the excitement and potential profitability surrounding such innovations attract increased investment, talent, and research efforts, further accelerating invention activity. As a result, emerging sectors not only reflect technological novelty but also signal areas where industries are being fundamentally reshaped.\n"

    "Analysing the trends in unique patent families across different fields can provide valuable insights into identifying emerging technologies. By visualising the growth trajectories of patenting activity over time, it becomes possible to distinguish fields that exhibit sudden and sharp increases in invention activity from those with more stable or moderate growth patterns. Fields with accelerated growth often signal emerging trends, as they may reflect the impact of disruptive technologies or heightened interest in areas of significant technological novelty.\n",
    "\n",
    "The involvement of multiple countries in such trends further highlights the global competitiveness and strategic importance of these fields. Emerging sectors typically display not only rapid growth but also an increasing concentration of efforts and resources, indicating their potential to redefine industries or create entirely new markets. However, to accurately assess the level of effort and resource allocation in these fields, a more detailed analysis is required. This would involve examining the geographic distribution of inventors, the presence of high-value inventions, and the dynamics of collaboration between key stakeholders in these fields."

    "Another approach that could be considered for analysing growth patterns across different fields is the use of the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR). To gain a more nuanced understanding of growth trends, we computed the CAGR for each sector over the 10-year period from 2013 to 2022. The CAGR is a useful metric for analysing the growth of a sector, country, or other parameter over time, as it provides a \"smoothed\" measure of growth. By excluding the effects of short-term fluctuations, it enables a more reliable assessment of the average annual growth rate over the observation period.\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation process began with aggregating the data by Field and earliest_publn_year, summing the unique family counts for each combination. Next, we calculated the CAGR for each field by comparing the values at the start (2013) and end (2022) of the period, taking into account the number of years in between. This method allows for a clear understanding of both the relative growth rate and the total increase in patent families.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula used for CAGR is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{CAGR} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Final Count}}{\\text{Initial Count}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\text{Number of Years}}} - 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula correctly calculates the average annual growth rate for each field over the time period under consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure accuracy, we made sure that the initial count was non-zero, which prevents any issues with the calculation. The resulting data was then stored and organised into a DataFrame, sorted by CAGR in descending order. This approach helps highlight the sectors with the highest growth, offering a clearer picture of the areas with the most significant long-term growth trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the CAGR method provides a useful long-term growth perspective, it is important to consider the potential limitations of this approach. Specifically, the CAGR is a simplification that does not account for potential fluctuations or variations within the years of the period, which may mask shorter-term trends. As such, while the CAGR highlights sustained growth, it is still valuable to combine this analysis with other methods, such as examining year-to-year changes or more granular data, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of sector dynamics.\n"

    "In conclusion, our preliminary analysis has shown that there are various ways to identify emerging fields. Looking at sectors with high innovation intensity, it becomes clear that Europe is not leading in any of the identified fields. For instance, when examining the field of Computer Technology, Europe’s contribution is the weakest among the major states, although it remains close to the levels seen in Japan and South Korea. In Digital Communication, the clear leaders are China and the United States, while Europe, on the other hand, is on par with Japan, showing a similar level of contribution. In the field of Medical Technology, European contracting countries rank second, yet the United States remains the undisputed leader in this domain.\n",

    "This highlights the critical need for Europe to enhance its investments in these high-potential areas to ensure it remains competitive globally. While Europe has made strides in emerging sectors, it must ramp up efforts to catch up with the innovation leaders. Identifying and addressing these innovation gaps is essential for shaping Europe’s future R&D strategy and ensuring its leadership in the global innovation landscape. We have explored one approach to begin investigating which fields are emerging fields."

    "#### Rationale Behind the Analysis of Top Applicants\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of the top applicants over the periods 2013-2017 and 2018-2022 aims to observe the evolution of innovation and the competitive landscape within the **Computer Technology** field. By splitting the data into two time periods, we can identify companies that have consistently led the field, as well as those who have risen or fallen in rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by filtering the data to include only patent families published between 2013 and 2017 and 2018 and 2022. This allows us to focus on the most relevant inventions during these specific periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "To examine the dynamics between companies, we group the data by the company name and country code, counting the number of patent families for each combination. This gives us insight into which companies were the most active in filing patents during these periods. We then identify the top 25 companies by the number of patent families filed and calculate their share of the total patent families in each period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we merge the two data sets to compare the top 25 companies in both periods and assess their ranking changes. The `ranking_change` function was applied to determine if a company has moved up, down, or remained in the same position in the rankings between 2013-2017 and 2018-2022."
