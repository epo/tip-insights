    "## Evolution of patenting activity in Europe - An analysis of technological fields\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we analyze the evolution of patenting activity in Europe, focusing on changes within individual technological fields as defined by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). Using data from PATSTAT Global, we will extract raw data, process it into a structured format using Pandas, and utilize third-party libraries to visualize the findings in an engaging manner. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerrequisites\n",
    "This notebook has been written for an audience already familiar with TIP. For users completely new to the platform, we recommend to follow the [TIP basic course](https://e-courses.epo.org/course/view.php?id=416) before reading this analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Disclaimer \n",
    "This notebook is published as a showcase of the capabilities of TIP as a data processing environment. It is not intended to derive any statistical conclusion other than the presentation of the retrieved data. The EPO is not expressing any opinion extrapolated from the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The WIPO technology fields\n",
    "WIPO provides a comprehensive technology concordance table that is particularly useful for studying general technology trends. Patent classification schemes such as the International Patent Classification (IPC) can often be too granular for broad statistical analysis. To address this, the WIPO concordance organizes IPC symbols into 35 distinct technology fields, further grouped into five higher-level technology sectors:\n",

    "The PATSTAT Global database links IPC symbols to WIPO technology fields via the `TLS230_APPLN_TECHN_FIELD` table, which serves as the foundation for our analysis.\n",

    "## Initialization\n",
    "As with any analysis involving PATSTAT, we need to initialize the client. The PATSTAT client can be initialized in production with access to the whole PATSTAT database, or in test with a smaller test database. This notebook is published with the client initialized in production with `env='PROD'`. If you want to modify it, we recommend you initialze the client with `env='TEST'` to reduce the time to process your queries. When you are happy with your code and are ready to conduct the real analysis, you can change the environment to production.\n",

    "We will be working with object relational mapping (ORM) as the recommended method of retrieving data from PATSTAT. For that need to import the three PATSTAT tables we will be working with. "

    "## Understanding the query\n",
    "This query retrieves data on European patent applications, focusing on their filing year, technological field, and associated weights from the **PATSTAT** database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `db.query`:\n",
    "Creates the query object that specifies what columns to retrieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`TLS201_APPLN.appln_id`**: The unique identifier for each patent application.\n",
    "- **`TLS201_APPLN.appln_filing_year`**: The year the patent application was filed. This column is labeled as `'Year'` for clarity in the resulting DataFrame.\n",
    "- **`TLS230_APPLN_TECHN_FIELD.techn_field_nr`**: The code representing the technological field associated with the application.\n",
    "- **`TLS230_APPLN_TECHN_FIELD.weight`**: A numerical value indicating the relative contribution of this application to the technological field.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Joining Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "The query joins two tables:\n",
    "1. **`TLS201_APPLN`**: Contains general information about patent applications.\n",
    "2. **`TLS230_APPLN_TECHN_FIELD`**: Contains data linking applications to their respective WIPO technology fields and weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "The join is based on the `appln_id` column, which is present in both tables and serves as the foreign key linking them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filtering Results\n",
    "Filters the query results to include only:\n",
    "1. Applications filed on or before the year 2022 (`TLS201_APPLN.appln_filing_year <= 2022`).\n",
    "2. Applications with `'EP'` (European Patent Office) as the authority (`TLS201_APPLN.appln_auth == 'EP'`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Result\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable **`res`** holds the resulting DataFrame, which contains the following columns:\n",
    "- **`appln_id`**: Unique application identifier.\n",
    "- **`Year`**: Year of application filing.\n",
    "- **`techn_field_nr`**: Technology field code.\n",
    "- **`weight`**: Relative weight of the application in its technology field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the query joins the `TLS201_APPLN` and `TLS230_APPLN_TECHN_FIELD` tables, an application (`appln_id`) can appear multiple times in the resulting DataFrame. This occurs because a single application can be associated with multiple WIPO technology fields (`techn_field_nr`). Each record represents one unique combination of an application and its corresponding technology field, along with the relative weight (`weight`) indicating its contribution to that field.\n"

    "## The weights  in `TLS230_APPLN_TECHN_FIELD`\n",
    "These weights reflect the proportional contribution of a patent application to a specific WIPO technology field. The weight is calculated by dividing 1 by the number of unique IPC subclasses assigned to the application. If a patent is classified into multiple IPC subclasses, each subclass receives an equal fraction of the total weight. This ensures that each patent contributes equally to the technological fields it is assigned to, avoiding overrepresentation of applications with extensive classification coverage.\n",

    "## Aggregating the weights\n",
    "The next step for the analysis is to aggregate the weights per year and per technology field. Here it is important to consider that although there can be multiple entries for a given application in our dataframe, the sum of the weights for one given application should be one. It follows that when we sum the weights per field we are not counting applications more than once. What is happening is that the contribution of each application to each technology field for that year is accurately distributed. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we will use pandas DataFrames, a versatile tool for data manipulation and analysis in Python, allowing efficient operations like filtering, aggregation, and reshaping.
